How to edit this: test-2025
* Option-1 (tested and worked ok): PyCharm supports editing of these .md files. Then you need to push to the main branch or make a pull request.
* Option-2 (tested ok): Edit and commit it directly on github. Then any local repo copies will need to be "updated"

## Project overview   
## (Link to the code repository: https://github.com/YichuanZhangthemostHANDSOMEone/CP3407-Group5-IF-Guider-project)    
（Internet fundamental learning guide）  
This interactive app uses visual simulations, guided experiments, and real-time feedback to demystify TCP/IP, DNS, routing, and HTTP.
Structured modules—from packet tracing to network configuration—transform abstract theory into hands-on exercises.
The system adapts to each student’s strengths and weaknesses, offering personalized hints and resources.
Learners build confidence in Internet fundamentals, bridging classroom lectures and real-world networking skills.
## Goal
  Our primary goal is to create an engaging, easy-to-navigate platform that accelerates students’ mastery of Internet fundamentals by seamlessly integrating theoretical concepts with practical, hands-on exercises. Through interactive labs and real-time feedback, we aim to demystify complex protocols, encourage curiosity, and cultivate problem-solving skills that translate directly to real-world networking scenarios. By adapting to each learner’s pace and providing targeted guidance when misunderstandings occur, we strive to ensure that every student achieves a solid, confidence-building comprehension of networking basics, ultimately preparing them for advanced coursework and professional challenges in the digital age.
