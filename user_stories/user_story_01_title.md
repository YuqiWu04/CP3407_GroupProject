## Internet Concepts
As a teacher, I want students to understand how the Internet works so students can work effectively in IT and cybersecurity disciplines.
## Immediate Feedback
As a teacher, I want immediate feedback on student activities so that I can timely respond if students are confused.
## Identify Common Errors
As a teacher, I want to identify common student errors quickly so that I can tailor class explanations and examples accordingly.
## Interactive Learning Experience
As a student, I want interactive experience and feedback during the exercise so that I can learn while doing the activity.
## Visual Protocol Tutorials
As a student, I want to visually learn how each protocol works so that I can fully grasp the concept of data on the Internet.
## Hands-on Activities
As a student, I want to get some hands-on activities in class so that I can learn by doing rather than just listening.
## Practical Guidance
As a student, I want guidance on actual tasks rather than abstract concepts so I can confidently apply concepts and improve performance.

## Priority: 10 (e.g. latest for iteration-1)
Any notes on priority go here. 
Note you may have different priorities at different stages of you project.
Again, keep all changes here for marking.

## Estimation: e.g. 2 days
Any notes on estimation go here. Keep your planning poker game numbers. For example
* Bob: 1 day (e.g. estimated before iteration-1)
* Lisa: 2 days
* Jack: 3 days

## Assumptions (if any):

## Description: e.g. The web page will show current deals to Orion's orbits users
You need to keep all versions here so that your instructor/marker can see your changes easily. 
In a real project, your older versions could be viewed via commits.

Description-v1: e.g. The web site will show current deals to Orion's orbits users

## Tasks, see chapter 4.
