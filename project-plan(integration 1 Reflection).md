What have we learned?

Throughout the beginning, we choose this Internet Fundamental AR program is seeking for a challenge when it comes to development with lots of API and core features with concept at VR/AR fusion developing in the future.
(although the VR/AR infrastructure is getting closer and closer to the niche marketing, like educational, or elite immersive visualization experience, Apple Vision Pro is a typical example.)
However, during the development, we had acquired some emotional satisfying that we firmly believe that every university student supposedly gains all this basement knowledge in a positive motivation, we are persuaded to have
a high level of the interface's aesthetic, while maintaining the reliable usage when we are developing our internal function that matches and attempting to satisfy customer's requirement. It is a pleasure moment to participate in
this Programming Project that helps release another university student to decline and discover the interesting side during the Internet Fundamental courses, without getting stuck with all the abstract conception idea.
